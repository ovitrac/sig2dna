# 📁 `images`

This folder contains figures and visual outputs generated by examples and demonstrations of the `sig2dna_core` library.

## Guidelines

- Store output figures (e.g., `.png`, `.svg`, `.jpg`) from tutorials, notebooks, or API demos
- Prefer vector formats (`.svg`, `.pdf`) for clarity in docs
- Refer to these images in Markdown or reStructuredText using relative paths
